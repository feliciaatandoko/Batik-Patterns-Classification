# Batik-Patterns-Classification

This project aims to classify three famous Indonesian batik patterns—Parang, Mega Mendung, and Kawung—using deep learning. The challenge is to accurately recognize and classify these motifs, which vary in shape and design, to help automate the identification of traditional batik patterns. I experimented with several models, including custom-built models and various transfer learning models, to compare their performance and determine which model yields the best results for batik pattern classification.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dionisiusdh/indonesian-batik-motifs), contains 142 images of the three batik motifs. These images are used for training and testing the deep learning model.
